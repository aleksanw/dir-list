# dir-list
Instant recursive directory listing with PHP + .htaccess

### Requirements:
Apache server with PHP. (This describes most shared-hosting servies.)

### Usage:
Simply add these two files to a directory and it and its sub-directories will get listings when accessed.

### Why not use the directory listing included in Apache?
Some shared-hosting services disable the included directory listing. (Yes, they are being unreasonable.) Also this dir-list is prettier.
